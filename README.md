# supervised-learning-hotel-booking-cancellation-prediction
Background
Customer behavior and booking possibilities have been radically changed by online hotel reservation channels. Cancellations or no-shows cause a significant number of hotel reservations to be canceled. Cancellations can be caused by a variety of factors, such as scheduling conflicts, changes in plans, etc. In many cases, this is made easier by the possibility of doing so free or at a low cost, which is beneficial for hotel guests but less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing for hotels.
The cancellation of bookings impact a hotel on various fronts:
•	Loss of resources (revenue) when the hotel cannot resell the room.
•	Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.
•	Lowering prices last minute, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reducing the profit margin.
•	Human resources to make arrangements for the guests.
As a data scientist, the objective is to analyze the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build an optimum predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help the Hotel Owners better understand if the customer is going to honor the reservation or cancel it.
